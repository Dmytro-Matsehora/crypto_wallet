- The project is implemented on the basis of **Nuxt3**.
- **Pinia** was used as storage.
- Markup is completely done on **TailwindCSS**.
- **Decimal.js** is used to round currency balances.

*P.S. in the demo link, the currency icons are static, but their dynamics is implemented in the project*

## P.S.
*It was a very interesting and valuable experience for me, I am glad that I managed to complete this task and I hope I coped with it with dignity. I worked with all the technologies used for the first time, and to be honest, I liked it.*
